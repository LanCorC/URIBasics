# Introduction to old and new Java classes for Servers and Clients
Code here demonstrates different servers and clients, and how to handle multiple clients. 
Low level examples include:
* ServerSocket and Socket classes, ServerSocketChannels and SocketChannel classes for TCP connections
* DatagramSocket and DatagramChannel for UDP connections 

High level examples include:
* URLConnection and HttpURLConnection for network connections
* Java's HttpServer class
* HttpServer as an improvement to HttpUrlConnection 


Data manipulation and communication is also explored, with channels and buffers. Examples of classes include:
